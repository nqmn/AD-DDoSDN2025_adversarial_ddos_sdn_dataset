# Progress on Running Application on Remote Server

## Current Status
The remote server has been shut down, so no further actions can be performed at this time. The application is not yet successfully running on the remote server.

## Detailed Implementation and Debugging Log:

### 1. Initial Request and Environment Setup
*   **User Request:** Run the application on a remote server using SSH.
*   **Initial Action:** Read `ssh_connect.py` and `main.py` to understand the existing setup.
*   **Information Needed:** Remote server hostname/IP, SSH port, username, password, and the remote path for the `dataset_generation` directory.
*   **User Provided:** Remote path `/home/user/dataset`.

### 2. Directory Transfer and Initial Execution Attempts
*   **Action:** Attempted to copy the `dataset_generation` directory to the remote server using `scp`.
*   **Issue:** `ssh_connect.py`'s `copy_file` function was designed for single files, not directories. Used `scp` via `run_shell_command` instead.
*   **User Confirmation:** Confirmed `dataset_generation` was on `/home/user`.

### 3. Dependency Installation Challenges
*   **Action:** Attempted to install Python dependencies (`requirements.txt`) on the remote server.
*   **Issue:** `pip` command not found, then `python3 -m pip` also failed with "command not found".
*   **Diagnosis:** Suspected incorrect command execution due to extraneous quotes in `ssh_connect.py`.
*   **Debugging:** Tested with `ls -l` and `echo hello`, both failed with "command not found", confirming the quote issue.
*   **Resolution:** Modified `ssh_connect.py` to strip extraneous quotes from commands.
*   **Re-attempt:** Retried `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`.
*   **New Issue:** `ERROR: Could not open requirements file: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'requirements.txt --dir /home/user/dataset_generation'`. This indicated the `--dir` argument was being passed to `pip` instead of `ssh_connect.py`.
*   **Resolution:** Further modified `ssh_connect.py` to correctly parse the `--dir` argument and separate it from the command to be executed.
*   **Re-attempt:** Successfully installed dependencies.

### 4. Application Execution and Sudo Privileges
*   **User Confirmation:** `sudo mn` and `ryu-manager` are confirmed to be installed on the remote server.
*   **Action:** Attempted to run `main.py` in the background using `nohup`.
*   **Issue:** `main.py` exited immediately. `output.log` showed "This script requires sudo privileges. Please run with sudo."
*   **Action:** Attempted to run `main.py` with `sudo`.
*   **Issue:** `sudo: no tty present and no askpass program specified`. This is a common issue when running `sudo` non-interactively without proper `sudoers` configuration.
*   **User Instruction:** Advised user to manually configure `sudoers` or run the command directly via SSH.
*   **User Confirmation:** User indicated they had "done" this.

### 5. File Path and Mininet/Ryu Connection Issues (Post-Sudo)
*   **Action:** Checked `main.py` status and `output.log`.
*   **Issue:** `main.py` was still not running. `output.log` showed `FileNotFoundError: '/home/user/dataset_generation/dataset_generation/topology.py'`.
*   **Diagnosis:** Incorrect path in `config.json`.
*   **Resolution:** Corrected `mininet_topology` and `ryu_app` paths in `config.json` on the remote server using `sed`.
*   **Action:** Re-attempted to run `main.py` with `sudo` (via the `restart_remote_app.py` script).
*   **Issue:** Still encountered `sudo: no tty present` error.
*   **User Instruction:** Re-iterated the need for manual execution of `sudo` commands on the remote server.
*   **User Confirmation:** User indicated they had "done" this.
*   **Action:** Checked `main.py` status and `output.log`.
*   **Issue:** `main.py` was running, but `output.log` showed "Unable to contact the remote controller at 127.0.0.1:6633" and `AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'send_signal'`. `ryu_controller.log` was not found.
*   **Diagnosis:** Ryu controller not starting correctly or Mininet connecting too soon. `host.cmd()` returns a string, not a process object, causing the `AttributeError`.
*   **Resolution (Attempted):** Increased `time.sleep` in `main.py` from 5 to 10 seconds. Modified `main.py` to use `host.popen()` and redirect Ryu's output to `ryu_controller.log`.
*   **User Instruction:** Advised user to manually stop processes and restart `main.py`.
*   **User Confirmation:** User indicated they had "done" this.
*   **Action:** Checked `main.py` status and `output.log`.
*   **Issue:** `main.py` was running, but the Ryu connection issue persisted, and the `AttributeError` was still present. `ryu_controller.log` was still not found.
*   **Diagnosis:** The `main.py` changes were not consistently applied to the remote server.

### 6. Ryu Library and `main.py` Synchronization
*   **Action:** Attempted to run `ryu-manager` directly to diagnose.
*   **Issue:** `ImportError: cannot import name 'ControllerWSGI'`.
*   **Resolution:** Uninstalled and reinstalled `eventlet` (a dependency of Ryu).
*   **Action:** Re-attempted to run `ryu-manager` directly.
*   **Issue:** `ImportError: cannot import name 'ALREADY_HANDLED'` from `eventlet.wsgi`.
*   **Action:** Re-applied `host.popen()` fix to `main.py` and ensured Ryu's output redirection.
*   **User Instruction:** Advised user to manually stop processes and restart `main.py`.
*   **User Request:** User asked me to run the `restart_remote_app.py` script.
*   **Action:** Attempted to run `restart_remote_app.py`.
*   **Issue:** `restart_remote_app.py` was not found locally.
*   **Resolution:** Created `restart_remote_app.py` locally.
*   **Action:** Ran `restart_remote_app.py`.
*   **Action:** Checked `main.py` status and `output.log`.
*   **Issue:** `main.py` was not running, and `output.log` still showed the `AttributeError` and `ryu_controller.log` was not found. This indicates the `main.py` changes are still not consistently applied to the remote server.

### 7. Incorporating Adversarial Attacks and Dataset Balancing (Planned)
*   **Goal:** Modify `config.json` and `main.py` to include and differentiate between basic and adversarial attacks, and to balance the dataset.
*   **Planned `config.json` changes:**
    *   Rename existing basic attack types (e.g., `syn_flood` to `basic_syn_flood`).
    *   Add new entries for adversarial attacks, referencing `gen_advanced_adversarial_ddos_attacks.py`.
    *   Include an `attack_function` field to specify which function within `gen_advanced_adversarial_ddos_attacks.py` should be called (e.g., `multi_vector_attack`, `slow_read_attack`, `tcp_state_exhaustion`).
    *   Add an `attack_args` dictionary for adversarial attacks to pass specific arguments to their functions.
    *   **Crucially, increase `normal.duration` from 60 seconds to 1800 seconds (30 minutes) to balance the normal traffic duration with the total attack duration (1800 seconds).** This aims to achieve a more balanced number of online flow samples between normal and attack periods for a single run.
*   **Planned `main.py` changes:**
    *   Update the `_generate_traffic` method to dynamically call the appropriate attack function based on the `attack_function` and `attack_args` fields in `config.json`.

## Next Steps:

1.  **Remote Server Availability:** Wait for the remote server to be back online.
2.  **Force Copy `main.py`:** Once the server is available, I will force copy the local, corrected `main.py` to the remote server to ensure all fixes are applied.
3.  **Update `config.json`:** Apply the planned changes to `config.json` on the remote server to include adversarial attacks and the updated normal traffic duration.
4.  **Diagnose Ryu Controller Startup:** Re-run the application and examine `ryu_controller.log` for specific errors related to Ryu's startup.
5.  **Address any new errors:** Based on the new logs, we will continue to debug and resolve any further issues.
