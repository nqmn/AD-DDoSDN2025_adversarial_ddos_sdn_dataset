Modify `config.json` to customize the experiment:

```json
{
    "mininet_topology": "topology.py",
    "ryu_app": "controller/ryu_controller_app.py",
    "controller_port": 6633,
    "api_port": 8080,
    "traffic_types": {
        "normal": {
            "duration": 300,
            "scapy_commands": [
                {"host": "h3", "command": "sendp(Ether()/IP(dst='10.0.0.5')/TCP(dport=80, flags='S'), loop=1, inter=0.1)"}
            ]
        },
        "attacks": [
            {
                "type": "syn_flood",
                "duration": 60,
                "attacker": "h1",

}
```

### Adding New Attacks

1. Create a new attack script in the `attacks/` directory:
   ```python
   # attacks/gen_new_attack.py
   from scapy.all import *
   import time
   
   def run_attack(attacker_host, victim_ip, duration):
       print(f"Starting attack from {attacker_host.name} to {victim_ip}")
       start_time = time.time()
       while time.time() - start_time < duration:
           # Your attack logic here
           send(IP(dst=victim_ip)/TCP(dport=80, flags='S'), verbose=0)
   ```

2. Add the attack to `config.json`:

```


## 5. Deliverables Verification

Upon successful completion, verify that the following files have been created in the `dataset_generation` directory:

The provision of three distinct datasets‚Äîpacket-level, SDN controller flow-level, and advanced flow-level (CICFlow)‚Äîis intentional, offering a multi-faceted view of network traffic. Each dataset caters to different analytical needs and machine learning applications:
- **Packet-level data (`packet_features.csv`)** provides the most granular view, capturing individual packet characteristics. This is crucial for deep-dive analysis, understanding low-level attack signatures, and developing models that require fine-grained features.
- **SDN controller flow-level data (`ryu_flow_features.csv`)** offers insights directly from the network's control plane. This dataset is invaluable for real-time anomaly detection within SDN environments, as it reflects the controller's perspective on traffic flows and can be used to develop proactive mitigation strategies.
- **Advanced flow-level data (`cicflow_dataset.csv`)** generated by CICFlowMeter, provides a rich set of statistical features derived from aggregated packet information. This higher-level abstraction is highly effective for machine learning models, as it summarizes flow behavior, making it easier to identify complex attack patterns and reducing the dimensionality of the data compared to raw packet captures.

-   `packet_features.csv`: A CSV file containing processed offline traffic data. This dataset provides **packet-level features** and is ideal for detailed analysis of individual packet characteristics and for building models that require granular network information. It contains **20 features** including the labels.
    -   `timestamp`: Packet capture timestamp.
    -   `packet_length`: Total length of the captured packet in bytes.
    -   `eth_type`: Ethernet type (e.g., 0x0800 for IPv4).
    -   `ip_src`: Source IP address.
    -   `ip_dst`: Destination IP address.
    -   `ip_proto`: IP protocol number (e.g., 6 for TCP, 17 for UDP, 1 for ICMP).
    -   `ip_ttl`: Time to Live.
    -   `ip_id`: IP identification field.
    -   `ip_flags`: IP flags (e.g., Don't Fragment, More Fragments).
    -   `ip_len`: Total length of the IP packet (including IP header and data).
    -   `src_port`: Source port (for TCP/UDP packets).
    -   `dst_port`: Destination port (for TCP/UDP packets).
    -   `tcp_flags`: TCP flags (e.g., SYN, ACK, FIN, RST, PSH, URG).
    -   `tcp_seq`: TCP Sequence Number.
    -   `tcp_ack`: TCP Acknowledgment Number.
    -   `tcp_window`: TCP Window Size.
    -   `icmp_type`: ICMP Type (for ICMP packets).
    -   `icmp_code`: ICMP Code (for ICMP packets).
    -   `Label_multi`: This column provides a multi-class label indicating the specific type of traffic or attack (e.g., 'normal', 'syn_flood', 'udp_flood', 'icmp_flood', 'ad_syn_flood', 'ad_udp_flood', 'ad_icmp_flood', 'ad_multi_vector'). This is useful for fine-grained classification tasks.
    -   `Label_binary`: This column provides a binary label for traffic classification, where `0` indicates 'normal' traffic and `1` indicates any type of 'attack' traffic. This is suitable for binary classification (anomaly detection) models.

-   `ryu_flow_features.csv`: A CSV file containing flow statistics polled from the Ryu controller. This dataset provides **flow-level features** directly from the SDN controller, making it suitable for real-time anomaly detection and control plane analysis. It contains **13 features** including the labels.
    -   `timestamp`: The timestamp when the flow statistics were polled.
    -   `datapath_id`: The unique identifier of the OpenFlow switch (DPID).
    -   `flow_id`: A unique identifier for the flow (Ryu's cookie).
    -   `ip_src`: Source IP address of the flow.
    -   `ip_dst`: Destination IP address of the flow.
    -   `port_src`: Source port of the flow (TCP or UDP).
    -   `port_dst`: Destination port of the flow (TCP or UDP).
    -   `ip_proto`: IP protocol number of the flow.
    -   `packet_count`: Number of packets that matched this flow entry.
    -   `byte_count`: Number of bytes that matched this flow entry.
    -   `duration_sec`: Duration of the flow in seconds.
    -   `Label_multi`: This column provides a multi-class label indicating the specific type of traffic or attack (e.g., 'normal', 'syn_flood', 'udp_flood', 'icmp_flood', 'ad_syn_flood', 'ad_udp_flood', 'ad_icmp_flood', 'ad_multi_vector'). This is useful for fine-grained classification tasks.
    -   `Label_binary`: This column provides a binary label for traffic classification, where `0` indicates 'normal' traffic and `1` indicates any type of 'attack' traffic. This is suitable for binary classification (anomaly detection) models.

-   `traffic.pcap`: The raw packet capture from the simulation.
-   `label_timeline.csv`: A CSV file containing the timeline of normal and attack traffic labels.

-   `cicflow_dataset.csv`: A CSV file generated from `traffic.pcap` using CICFlowMeter. This dataset provides **advanced flow-level features** derived from packet data, offering a richer set of statistical metrics for in-depth traffic analysis and machine learning model training. It contains 83 flow features extracted by CICFlowMeter and an additional `Label_multi` and `Label_binary` column, totaling **85 features**.

If these files are present, the operation was a success.
