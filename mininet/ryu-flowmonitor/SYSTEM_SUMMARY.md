# Federated learning parameters
AGGREGATION_INTERVAL = 600     # Global model update interval
CLIENT_SYNC_INTERVAL = 300     # Client synchronization interval
MODEL_COMPRESSION = True       # Enable model compression
```

### CICFlowMeter

# Traffic capture settings
CAPTURE_DURATION = 300         # 5-minute capture windows
CAPTURE_INTERFACE = "any"      # Capture all interfaces
FEATURE_EXTRACTION = True      # Enable feature extraction
```

## 🚨 Security Considerations

### Network Security
- **API Access Control**: Restrict to trusted networks
- **Encrypted Communication**: Use HTTPS for production
- **Authentication**: Implement API key authentication
- **Firewall Rules**: Limit access to required ports

### Data Protection
- **Model Encryption**: Encrypt saved ML models
- **Log Rotation**: Automatic log cleanup
- **Traffic Privacy**: Anonymize captured data
- **Secure Storage**: Encrypted storage for sensitive data

## 🔄 Maintenance and Updates

### Regular Maintenance
```bash
# Update ML models
./enhanced_run_script.sh retrain-models

# Clean old logs
find logs/ -name "*.log" -mtime +30 -delete

# Compress old captures
find traffic_captures/ -name "*.pcap" -mtime +7 -exec gzip {} \;
```

### System Updates
```bash
# Update Python packages
pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade

# Update system packages
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
```

## 📞 Support and Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Controller Connection Failed**: Check firewall and network connectivity
2. **ML Models Not Loading**: Verify scikit-learn installation
3. **CICFlowMeter Errors**: Ensure Java is installed
4. **Federated Learning Issues**: Check network connectivity between servers
