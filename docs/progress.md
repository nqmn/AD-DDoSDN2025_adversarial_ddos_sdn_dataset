# Adversarial DDoS Attacks SDN Dataset - Progress

## Current Status

This project is now streamlined to focus on dataset generation using `dataset_generation/test.py`. All non-essential files and directories have been removed to simplify the project structure and focus on the core functionality.

## Recent Progress

-   **Project Streamlining**: Removed extraneous files and directories, focusing the project around `dataset_generation/test.py`.
-   **Documentation Updates**: Updated `README.md` files (root and `dataset_generation/`) and `docs/` files (`install.md`, `analysis.md`, `scenario.md`) to reflect the current project structure and the role of `test.py`.

## Known Issues

-   None currently identified related to the streamlined project structure.

## Next Steps

-   Continue to refine the `dataset_generation/test.py` script and its associated modules.
-   Further enhance documentation as needed.
